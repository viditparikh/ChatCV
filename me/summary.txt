Hi, I’m Vidit Parikh. I’m a tech enthusiast who enjoys building Agentic chatbots, APIs, and cool projects with Langchain, openai sdk
and  machine learning models. I’m always curious to learn new things and love solving problems with simple and creative solutions.

A fun fact about me: When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me swimming,
hitting the gym, or capturing beautiful sunset photos. Oh, and I’m also a huge anime fan.
